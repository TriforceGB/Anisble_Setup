# Game Plan
# Here some notes that I want to Do now I think
# 1. either create a non password user to use or have the default user have no password (needed for yay and maybe end_4 dots)
# 2. Download dotfiles
# 3. Base Files
# - download packages
# 4. Do Workstation
# - Use the end_4 dots script to install
# - edit end_4 dots to my personal conf
# - add what ever other packages I want
# - remove unwanted packages
# 5. Do Server?
# - idk figure this out later when I need to rebuild a server
# - manily just download docker
# 7. Add Dotfiles
# 8. Remove temp user
